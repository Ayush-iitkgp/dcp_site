Stanford Disciplined Convex Programming Website
==========================================
This website is designed to teach disciplined convex programming (DCP). DCP is a system for constructing mathematical expressions with known curvature from a given library of base functions. DCP is used by the [convex optimization](http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) modeling languages [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) and [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) to ensure that the specified optimization problems are convex.

Visit the [DCP Quiz](/quiz) to practice applying the [DCP rules](/rules#rules) to mathematical expressions. Alternatively, visit the [DCP Analyzer](/analyzer) to type in expressions, equalities, and inequalities and see a visualization of the DCP analysis.
