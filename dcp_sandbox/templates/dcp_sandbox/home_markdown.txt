Disciplined Convex Programming
==========================================
This website is designed to teach disciplined convex programming (DCP). DCP is a system for constructing mathematical expressions with known curvature from a given library of base functions. DCP is used by the [convex optimization](http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) modeling languages [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/) and [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) to ensure that the specified optimization problems are convex.

After reading about the [DCP rules](/rules), visit the [DCP Quiz](/quiz) to test your understanding, or type expressions into the [DCP Analyzer](/analyzer).
